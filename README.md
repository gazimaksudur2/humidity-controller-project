# Humidity Controller

## Abstract
The Humidity Controller is a microprocessor-based project designed to regulate room humidity efficiently. This project utilizes a microcontroller to control a vaporization generator, aiming to increase the room's humidity levels. The key component responsible for monitoring the humidity levels is a hygrometer. By employing this system, the project ensures precise and effective control over the room's humidity automatically, providing a reliable solution for environments requiring specific humidity conditions.

## Introduction
Bangladesh is facing severe mid-winter cold, impacting daily life with dense nighttime fog. This has led to an increase in cold-related illnesses, particularly affecting children and the elderly. Additionally, the winter season brings very low humidity levels, emphasizing the importance of maintaining optimal humidity in controlled environments, greenhouses, and industrial processes. 

The Humidity Controller project addresses the need for a sophisticated system to manage room humidity. This project focuses on achieving this control by utilizing a microcontroller to regulate a vaporization generator. The microcontroller processes information from a hygrometer, a sensor designed to measure humidity accurately. By interfacing the microcontroller with the vaporization generator, the system can adjust the humidity levels in the room as required.
